SVN Tools is a Rake plugin designed to make the common tasks under Rails more easy. The main things you might want to try are

rake svn:add
rake svn:del
# these two are just wrappers for some fancy sed stuff I got from the internets.

rake svn:commit
# this one takes your commit message at a prompt -- but it only take one line messages, yeah, just a gets.

rake svn:bootstrap
# this is the one I really wrote all this for. Run it on a brand new project to get things imported into a repository properly. It sets svn:ignore in the proper places, like log, tmp, and database.yml
